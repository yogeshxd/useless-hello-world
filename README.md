# useless-hello-world
Randomly pics a alphabet and checks it untill hello world is printed.

This peice of code prints classic hello world but the twist is 
that it chooses a random alphabet and compares it to the aplphabets of hello world
until it gets it correct.
To demonstrate it more accurately this code will take a 0.2 sec break after printing
every correct alphabet and a 0.05 sec break for every wrong alphabet...
